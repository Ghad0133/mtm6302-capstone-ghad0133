Project: Pokedex
For my Pokedex mockup I went for a simple scroll page that displays pokemon as the pokedex would. I went with the standard pokemon colours of red, yellow and blue to give it that familiar pokemon feel. You can keep track of what pokemon you caught with the pokeball button on the top right of every pokemon entery. I went with OCR A Extended for the font, to me it looks very future like representing the pokedex as a piece of advanced technology.
